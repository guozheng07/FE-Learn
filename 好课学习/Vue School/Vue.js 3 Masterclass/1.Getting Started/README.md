# What Do I Need to Take the Vue 3 Masterclass?
In this lesson, weâ€™ll go through the software you need to take our Vue 3 Masterclass.

If you do not want to spend time watching the video make sure you have Chrome with Vue.js devtools (beta), a terminal for your operating system, and an editor or IDE with Vue.js support.

Here are some links to software that makes it easier to work with Vue.js. Recommended software are written in the top of each list.

Editors
- Webstorm
- VS Code / Volar / Vetur
- Sublime Text / vue-syntax-highlight
- Atom / atom-vue

Terminals
- Hyper - (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)
- iTerm 2 - (Mac OS)
- Git Bash (Windows)
- CMDER (Windows)
- Default Terminal (Mac OS and Linux)

Vue Devtools
- Vue Devtools for Chrome (now supports Vue 3)
- Vue Devtools Beta for Chrome

Update - If you are using VS Code the required extension for Vue.js 3 is now Volar (not Vetur).
